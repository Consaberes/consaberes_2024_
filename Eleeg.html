    <span> The electrical risks are dangers associates witht the use, handling and the exposure to the electricity. these risk can show up in a wide range of evironments, including homes, places of works, industrial facilities and public areas</span>

  <h3>ELECTRIC ARC</h3>

<snap>An electric arc is a discharge of electricity what happen between two points with potential diferece in a conducting medium, as the air. it form when cuando a specific voltage is exceeded and a conductive plasma channel is created.the electric arcs they can tigger heat, light intense and represent risk, as burns,equipanent damage and danger for the people. it is important to take precautions of security and use equpament of  personal protection  at the work near electric arcs.</snap>

  <h4> GROUNDING SYSTEMS </h4>

  <snap>As its name says, It is a protective grounding system for electrical installations which connects parts of them with the conductive surface of the earth. Technically, is the direct electrical connection of a part of an electrical circuit device to a electrode or groups of electrodes buried in the ground.</snap>

<h5>HIGH VOLTAGE NETWORK</h5>
<snap> the high voltage transmission lines are the infrastructure used to transmit and distribute electricity over long distances.The accidental collision of a person with an object can cause serious injuries.</snap>

  <h3> IMPROPER PROTECTION SIZE </h3>
<snap> The protections must be dimensioned to guarantee the safe operation of all the components, not only work equipment such as lamps or motors, but also the cables that feed them. The protection must be dimensioned taking into account the limits of both the devices and the cables, regarding long faults such as Overloads, which usually cause overheating or brief errors, such as short circuits that usually cause immediate errors. </snap>

<div class="content-main">
  
<h3> DAMP AND UNLOADING PLACES </h3>
<snap>Damp or wet places exist both outdoors and indoors. This includes areas not protected from the elements and/or exposed to water, liquids or moderate humidity, as this increases the risk of electric shock. Good grounding can also minimize risks in these locations.</snap>
</div>


<div class="content-main">
  <h3>DANGEROUS ZONES </h3>

  <snap> the installations in dangerous areas of fire or explosion, must be adequate for operate in this type of environment and ensure operation in all scenarios; Any vulnerability in this type of installation is critical.</snap>
