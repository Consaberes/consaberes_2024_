            </div>
            <h2>HOW DID BOGOTÁ EMERGE?</h2>
            <P>Bogotá was called Bacatá. Bacatá means farmland (field to sow) and it was the name given to this place by the Muiscas and Chibchas, indigenous peoples who were born here.
                A long time passed during which the only inhabitants of Bacatá were the indigenous peoples who were born here, but one day, women and men arrived on ships that sailed from a distant country called Spain, who also wanted to live in the land of Bacatá.
                
                With the arrival of the Spanish there was a war in the land of Bacatá, where many indigenous people including their rulers died.
                
                After their victory, the Spaniards, led by Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada, decided to transform the land of Bacatá with its tiny and distant villages into a bigger and different city, more similar to the cities of Spain (the place where they came from). ) and so they began to build it.

    <h3> CHORRO DE QUEVEDO </h3>
    <P> This small square is the best place to enjoy storytelling, gastronomy and art exhibitions outside the "traditional" circuit. It is an unmissable point for those who want to soak up popular culture and not just see art within the walls of a museum.
