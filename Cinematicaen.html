			<p>The objective of this work was to analyze the kinematics of an inertial flywheel in a laboratory of a university physics course using Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). The position, velocity and angular acceleration of said steering wheel as a function of time were determined simultaneously. ICT-based equipment was used that consisted of a device made up of a steering wheel, a weight, an inextensible rope and real-time data acquisition equipment made up of a rotation sensor, an interface, a computer and a computer program. . The results have allowed us to design a Practical Laboratory Work for the subject Physics I in which students are taught to treat the topic as a research work. Therefore, students are asked to document the report, argue the discussion and conclude on the main aspects of the study.</p>
			<p>Kinematics is a discipline of physics and mechanics, responsible for studying and describing the movement of objects in terms of trajectory and time variables. The term kinematics originates from the Greek word κινέιν or kinéin, which means 'to move or displace'.</p>
			<p>This discipline is not concerned with determining the causes that generate the movement, but is basically aimed at describing the displacement to identify its duration.</p>
			<p>Kinematics (from the Greek κινέιν kinéin 'to move, displace') is the branch of physics that describes the movement of solid objects without considering the causes that originate it (forces) and is limited, mainly, to the study of the trajectory in function of time. To do this, it uses velocities and accelerations, which describe how the position changes as a function of time. Velocity is determined as the quotient between the displacement and the time used, while acceleration is the quotient between the change in speed and the time used.</p>

		<h2>Examples of kinematics</h2>
	<p>The basic elements of kinematics are three: space, time and a mobile. We must take into consideration that in classical mechanics the first two (time and space) are absolute dimensions, independent of the mobile and prior to its existence.</p>
	<p>Space is described by Euclidean geometry, time is considered unique in any region of the universe, and a mobile can be any body in motion. The simplest mobiles are particles (and their study opens the field of particle kinematics), but more frequently rigid solids are considered (analogous to a system of particles and corresponding to what we know as bodies or objects).</p>

<h2>Kinematics Points</h2>

<div>

<p>Today we must be clear that science has been built and established from the knowledge that is acquired every day with the studies and research that have been done throughout history. These studies or investigations of specific topics in areas of science such as biology, chemistry, mathematics, physics, among others, have been characterized thanks to the use of the scientific method in the acquisition of new knowledge. Physics, for example, is an area of ​​science that is responsible for the study of the phenomena that occur around us and has specific branches such as kinematics, which is responsible for the study of movement without taking into account the forces that produce it. It is from the above that we can understand in a general way that science is the set of methods or techniques that lead to acquiring new knowledge, which in the first instance has the main objective of providing benefits to humanity, without forgetting the benefits that should be given. to our environment. The method used for years to acquire knowledge is the famous scientific method, which consists of applying certain stages or steps to achieve different studies and research on a particular topic, in our case, for the teaching of kinematics, which will use the scientific method as a necessary tool to improve the development of students' skills, taking into account that if it applies to this topic, it can also be applied to the study and teaching of other branches of Physics</p>
<p>Uniform line movement. A body moves at a constant speed v, with zero acceleration in a straight line.</p>
<p>Uniformly accelerated rectilinear motion. A body moves at a speed that varies linearly (since its acceleration is constant) as time progresses.</p>
<p>Simple harmonic motion. It is a periodic back-and-forth motion in which a body oscillates around an equilibrium point in a given direction and in regular units of time.</p>
<p>Parabolic movement. It is the composition of two different rectilinear movements: one horizontal and of constant speed, and another vertical and uniformly accelerated.</p>
<p>Uniform circular motion. As its name indicates, it is the movement that traces perfect circles along its path, keeping the module of its speed unchanged over time.</p>
<p>Uniformly accelerated circular motion. It is the movement that traces perfect circles along its path, but with a speed that varies in module over time.</p>
<p>Complex harmonic movement. It is the combination of various simple harmonic movements, in different directions.</p>
