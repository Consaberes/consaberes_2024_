        <h1>What is music?</h1>
        <p>Music is, according to the traditional definition of the term, the art of creating and organizing sounds and silences respecting the fundamental principles of melody, harmony and rhythm, through the intervention of complex psycho-psychic processes.

        <h1>¿What is a Musical Genre?</h1>
        <p>A musical genre is a category that brings together musical compositions that share different affinity criteria, such as their function, their instrumentation, the social context in which they are produced or the content of their text.</p>
        <h1>MUSICAL GENRES</h1>
        <h1>The main ones are:</h1>
        </p>RAP, K-POP, ROCK, ELECTRÓNICA, POP, CLÁSICA, COUNTRY, METAL, FUNK, JAZZ.
        <h1>CLASSIFICATION OF MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS</h1>
        <h3>:</h3>
        <h1>AEROPHONES</h1>
        <img src="./img/Trompeta (1).jpg" width="20%" heigth="20%" >
        <p>An aerophone is a musical instrument that produces sound mainly by making a body of air vibrate, without the use of strings or membranes, and without the vibration of the instrument itself considerably increasing the sound, among the best known are the trumpet, the flute and the saxophone among others.</p>
        <h1>CHORDOPHONES</h1>
        <img src="./img/Arpa (1).jpg" width="20%" heigth="20%">
        <p>String instruments or chordophones are musical instruments that produce sounds through the vibrations of one or more strings, usually amplified by means of a sound box. Among the most relevant folk chordophones, the harp, the rebec, the guitarrón, the charango and the guitar.</p>
        <h1>IDIOPHONES</h1>
        <img src="./img/Xilófono.jpg" width="20%" heigth="20%">
        <p>An idiophone, according to the Hornbostel-Sachs classification, is a musical instrument that has its own sound because it uses its body as resonating material. Idiophones are percussion instruments. It produces sound primarily by the vibration of the body itself, without the use of strings, membranes or air columns. Among the most important are the accordion, the cacharaína, the rattle and the torment.</p>
        <h1>MEMBRANOPHONES</h1>
        <img src="./img/Bongó.jpg" width="20%" heigth="20%">
        <p>A membranophone or membrane percussion instrument is called a musical instrument whose vibration occurs on a taut membrane made of skin or synthetic materials. Sometimes they can have two taut membranes, as in the case of some cylindrical instruments that have a patch at each end, the most widespread in their use are the bass drum, the snare drum and the drum.</p>

            <h1>MOST INFLUENTIAL / POPULAR MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS IN HISTORY</h1>
        </div>
        <div>
        <h2>Guitar</h2>
        <img src="./img/guitarra.webp" width="20%" heigth="20%"> 
        <p>The guitar is a musical instrument of the chordophone family, that is, it produces its sound by vibrating the strings. It is a plucked string instrument, with a sound box, a mast on which the storage room is attached, generally with an acoustic hole in the center of the top and six strings. The frets are embedded on the fingerboard, which allow the sounds to be divided into the 12 notes of the tonal system, making interpretation possible with greater ease.</p>
        </p>
        
        <h2>The Fiddle</h2>
        <img src="./img/Violín (1).jpg" width="20%" heigth="20%"> 
        <p>The word "violin" comes from violino, an Italian word that began to be used in 1537 and means "small viol". The Italian word is inspired by the French term vyollon, which was first used in 1529 to designate a name for the string family. The term began to spread as "violin" at the end of the 16th century. Whoever plays it is called a violinist.
        From the string family, it is the smallest and highest-pitched among its kind, which is composed of a figure-8 soundboard, a fretless neck, and four strings that are played with a bow. There can also be metal violins that are like a wooden one but the metal one does not have a bottom.</p>

        <h2> Drums </h2>
        <img src="./img/Batería.jpg" width="20%" heigth="20%">
        <p>The battery is a set of percussion musical instruments used by many musical groups. In some countries, the term "drummer" also refers to the musician who plays these instruments, as does the term "drummer", both equivalent. This instrument was born from the need to produce different percussions in a single grouped and comfortable system to be played simultaneously by a single person.</p>
        <p>A drum set is a set of drums, cymbals, and other percussion instruments, which are placed on stands to be played by a single musician, with drumsticks in both hands and feet actuating the pedals that control the hi-hat cymbal and the beater of the bass drum. Sometimes there may be two kick pedals to create a faster beat. A drum kit is made up of a mixture of drums (classically classified as membranophones, Hornbostel-Sachs High Level 2 classification) and idiophones, mostly cymbals, but may also include a Chinese snare drum and/or cowbell (classified as High Level 2). 1 of Hornbostel-Sachs). In the 2020s, some drum kits also include electronic instruments (Hornbostel-Sachs 53 rating). Likewise, both hybrid drums (which mix acoustic instruments and electronic drums) and fully electronic drums are used.</p>
        <p>A standard modern drum kit (for a right-handed player), as used in popular music and taught in music schools, contains:

        <p>A snare drum, mounted on a stand, placed between the musician's knees and played with sticks (which may include brushes)</p>
        <p>A bass drum, played with a pedal operated by the right foot, which moves a beater or felt-covered mallet</p>
        <p>Two or more toms, played with sticks or brushes.</p>
        <p>A hi-hat (two cymbals mounted on a stand), played with the sticks, which is opened and closed with the left foot pedal (it can also produce sound with the foot alone)</p>
        <p>One or more cymbals, mounted on stands, played with sticks
        </p>

        <h2>The Piano</h2>
        <img src="./img/Piano.jpg" width="20%" heigth="20%"> 
        <p>The word piano derives from the original Italian word for the instrument, pianoforte (piano: "soft" and forte: "loud"). This refers to the piano's ability to produce sounds with different intensities, depending on the weight applied to it. the keys. This feature set it apart from its predecessors, which could only produce a single volume.</p>
        <p>It is made up of a sound box to which a keyboard has been added through which the steel strings are struck with felt-covered hammers, which produces the sound. The vibrations are transmitted through the bridges to the soundboard, which amplifies them. It consists of a multi-string chromatic harp, activated by an indirect percussion mechanism, to which dampers have been added.</p>
        <p>Throughout history there have been different types of pianos, but the most common are the grand piano and the upright or wall piano. The tuning of the piano is a fundamental factor in the acoustics of the instrument and is done by modifying the tension of the strings so that they vibrate at the appropriate frequencies.</p>
        
        <h2>The Flute</h2>
        <img src="./img/Flauta.jpg" width="20%" heigth="20%"> 
        <p>A type of wind musical instrument is called a flute.</p>
        <p>It consists of a tube, generally made of wood or metal, with holes and a mouthpiece, on the edge (bevel) of which the sound is produced: The air can come directly from the performer's lips. In some cultures there are also flutes that are played through the nose.</p>
        <p>By opening or closing the holes in the tube of the instrument, the pitch of the sound is defined. The holes are covered in some cases directly with the fingertips, in others with keys.</p>
