		<h2> ¿How home automation works?</h2>
		<p>In a home automation installation, the different devices that make up a home automation network or system use a Wi-Fi network to send and receive information and to connect with the user. 
			The terminals are always devices such as household appliances, lighting devices or light points, air conditioning and ventilation equipment, blinds and awnings and any equipment capable of having intelligence or communication capacity with the programmable central system, introducing an interface for its control.The sensors within the set will collect sensitive information and the central unit will decide what actions to perform in relation to the information provided by said sensors. All system devices send and receive signals through a communications network to the central unit, in charge of managing information exchanges. The signals travel encoded in the form of communication protocols, so they need to be "translated" for each of the devices, similar to what happens in a computer network.
			In a home automation system and depending on where the control center or the intelligent system that will control the installation resides, we will have several different architectures:
			*Centralizd architecture: through the different sensors, processing the orders and sending them to the actuators, a centralized controller will control the installation.
			*Distributed architecture: as there is no central processing center, all the intelligence of the system is distributed through the different actuators and sensors, so bus wiring or wireless networks are normal.
			*Mixed architecture: in this modality we will have a basically decentralized architecture, since there are several small devices that acquire the information from different sensors and then this information is transmitted to the devices that are distributed throughout the network, for example, systems based on Zigbee and totally wireless. </p>

				<h2>ZIGBEE</h2>
				</div>
	<img src="./img/zigbee.png" width="50%" height="50%" alt="zigbee" class="img-center">
		<p>ZigBee is the name of the specification for a set of high-level wireless communication protocols for use with low-power digital broadcasting. Its objective is applications rate and maximization of the useful life of their batteries.</p>
		
	<div> 
		<h2> ¿What is Zigbee used for?</h2>
		<p> It is a set of communication protocols between devices, as we can do with WiFi or Bluetooth, specially designed for the IoT (Internet Of Things). They have a much lower consumption, as well as simpler hardware that allows lower costs. In addition, the connected devices can be battery or battery since the consumption is minimal.
			In principle, the area where this technology is expected to gain more strength is in home automation. The reason for this is several characteristics that differentiate it from other technologies:
			Its low consumption.
			Its mesh network topology.
			Its easy integration (nodes can be manufactured with very little electronics).

		<h2> ¿How a home automation works? </h2>
		<p> As we have already mentioned, home automation is the integration of a series of technologies or systems that allow us to automate the home in order to achieve maximum energy efficiency, optimal comfort and optimize the use of the energy we need. To know how a home automation or smart home works, it is important to know what systems or technologies we have on the market. Among these systems, it is worth mentioning:
			Efficient lighting systems: there are currently intelligent lighting systems that adapt the level of lighting (both interior and exterior) depending on the variation in sunlight, the area of the house or the presence of people, adjusting it to the needs at all times, allows you to avoid leaving lights on when leaving home.
			Intelligent automatic control of awnings, blinds and curtains in the home: allows sunlight to be used to the maximum.
			Regulation and control systems for air conditioning systems: they adapt the temperature of the home depending on the variation in the outside temperature, the time of day, the area of the house or the presence of people.
			Control or sequencing of the start-up of electrical appliances: programming their operation at times when the price of energy is lower.
			Detection of the opening and closing of windows: they notify the user if there are open windows when the air conditioning is activated.
			Detection and warning in the event of breakdowns, such as a gas or water leak, causing a supply cut that avoids the dangers that could be caused and the extra cost that it also entails.
			Intelligent irrigation control: through a humidity or rain sensor, it detects soil humidity and autonomously waters only when necessary.
			Smart taps: manage the flow and temperature of the water.
			As an example, we can estimate that the installation of a home automation system in a home that allows intelligent management of lighting and temperature in a 20 m2 room generates energy savings of around 25%. </p>

		<h2> Consumption monitoring	</h2>
		<p> In addition to direct energy savings, home automation facilitates good maintenance management of the facilities, with the consequent economic savings that this entails.
			Through the use of consumption monitoring systems, the user can be aware of the energy consumption of his home, which will provide him with the necessary information to be able to modify his habits and increase his savings and efficiency according to his needs.
			In addition, in those homes with photovoltaic self-consumption systems or electricity generation by photovoltaic solar energy or other systems, the monitoring systems will allow the control and management of electricity production.
			Currently, most home automation and consumption monitoring systems have applications that can be easily installed on any device and in this way allow us to control the alarm systems, air conditioning from the tablet, mobile, laptop or smart TV , doors, windows and lighting, among others, of our home.

	<div> 
		<h2> Smart houses </h2>
		<p> The first of the great advantages offered by home automation is energy savings.
			Another of the fundamental advantages that it offers us is comfort. The fact of being able to control light bulbs and air conditioning equipment and ventilation systems from our mobile devices, smart washing machines that notify when their operation is finished and refrigerators that worry about product expiration are just a few examples that contribute to improving our comfort. and comfort.
			There is also home security.

			<h2> Advantages and disadvantages of home automation </h2>
		</div>
			<h2> Advantages of home automation </h2>
			<p> The advantages provided in an intelligent design are infinite, since, thanks to the algorithms and the automation applied in the architectural structures, various special opportunities are generated, adapted to satisfy the needs of the users. Here we list some of the most important advantages.</p>
		</div>
		
	<img src="./img/imagen.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" alt="imagen" class="img-center">
		
	<div> 
		<h2> Security </h2>
		<p> Home security is a benefit that home automation offers, since it detects possible gas leaks in time, fires, water leaks and even, due to the use of cameras, this technology alerts in the event that a stranger or intruder trespasses the property .</p>
	</div>

	<div> 
		<h2> Energy saving </h2>
		<p> If we talk about saving energy consumption in a home, intelligent design is characterized by the reduction in service costs of a house, apartment or office. </p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<h2> Interrelationship and interconnection </h2>
		<p> Home automation includes the recognition of voice or body movements as a communication channel between the user and the architecture; It also works with telecare </p>
	</div>

	<div> 
		<h2> simplicity and comfort </h2>
		<p> Home automation guarantees practical benefits in its implementation and is measured by the number of tasks that the system executes, giving the user the convenience of performing them from their mobile phone. Through home automation, the automatic closing of the blinds is carried out, configuring the amount of sunlight that enters the rooms or the desired ventilation. </p>
	</div>

	<div> 
		<h2> Reduction of environmental damage </h2>
		<p> The implementation of home automation is capable of mitigating, in a very efficient way, the negative impacts that architecture generates on the environment, because it helps to avoid that alletric devices are understood without any use. In addition, home automation carefully monitors leaks, whether gas or water, preventing domestic accidents.   </p>
	</div>

	<div> 
		<h2> * Disadvantages of home automation </h2>
		<p> The disadvantages of home automation are minimal However, there are some cons of this system.  </p>
	</div>

	<div> 
		<h2> High installation cost </h2>
		<p> Due to its high standard of security and comfort, the installation of the home automation system has a high cost, which is why implementation processes are proposed in stages, depending on the interest and scope of the client for their project.  </p>
	</div>

	<div> 
		<h2> Maintenance </h2>
		<p>After installation, home automation requires sporadic maintenance to update the system and its networks. In the event of some type of breakdown or failure (which are almost non-existent), the network arrangement can be complex and expensive, since it is possible that an important part of the system is blocked and some of its functions are cancelled.   </p>
	</div>

	<div> 
		<h2> Data transmission speed </h2>
		<p> The performance of the functions will depend on the speed of the network and the number of users connected to the system, since when transferring a large number of users connected to the system, since when transferring a large amount of data, the network may become congested and decrease transmission speed. </p>
	</div>

	<div> 
		<h2> Smart design for your project </h2>
		<p> As stated in this publication, the advantages of home automation and its application in architectural projects outweigh its disadvantages. Home automation contributes efficiency and daily performance of the human being and their daily activities, evidencing a better quality of life.
